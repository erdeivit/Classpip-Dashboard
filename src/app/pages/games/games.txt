Module created by David Hern√°ndez on QP 2018/19 (Feb19 - Jun19) Contact: erdeivit@gmail.com

This module will become one of the main of the project, because one important point of the applicacion
is to play different types of games.

On 07/06/2018 we have:
- You can see what active games (now all related with questionnaires) we have, and we can sort by:
  - Active games (The finish date does not pass).
  - Programmed games (The start date does not pass).
  - Finish games (The finish date pass).

Clicking in one game, you can know what is it about.

There are also two buttons:
   - The first one that is create a game which sends you to createNewGame.html.
   - The other one is "watch results" which sends you to gamesResultComponent.


REMEMBER THAT ALL THIS GAMES ARE CREATED IN RELATION WITH ONE SPECIFIC GROUPID, BECAUSE PREVIOUSLY WE HAD SELECTED
ONE GROUP. SO THE GAMES AND THE RESULTS ARE ONLY FOR THIS GROUP.
