In this html you can configure all type of games. Now we can only configure the questionnaireGames:

The different configuration you can set is:

- Type of game:
    1.Quizpip: Classical way to answer a questionnaire. All the question will be display on the screen and you
    will have to answer all of them until you press the Submit button or the time passed away.
    2.Question by Question: On the screen will appear one question each time. When you answer the question and
    press the submit button (or the time passed away) will appear the next question.
    3.Qlasspip (Not implemented yet): It is thought to be similar to kahoot.
    4.FlipCardsPip: This mode is focused on the study. The question will appear on the screen and when you think
    that you guess the question, you will be able to know the answer (passing the mouse over there).
    5.TimeToLearn (Not implemented yet): It is though to launch a question (through bar notificacion) which will
    give points to the student. It can appear at any time (8:00-22:00).
